  <!--     This is what you need to know about key transformations that occur    -->
  <!-- when `Karabiner` aka `KeyRemap4macbook` gets in the middle. Keys are      -->
  <!-- effectively of two types:                                                 -->
  <!--                                                                           -->
  <!-- [osx] this is what OS receives and essentially what you believe you       -->
  <!-- press, as in when sending Cmd-F (OSX find) it is the meaning not the      -->
  <!-- physical keys you have in mind, the actual physical keys pressed and      -->
  <!-- thus bytes generated can have different names spelled out on your         -->
  <!-- physical keyboard. You can think of [osx] as essence, meaning.            -->
  <!--                                                                           -->
  <!-- [raw] is the actual raw keycode (byte) being sent - mapping between       -->
  <!-- the physical key you pressed and the byte (number) generated. So as to    -->
  <!-- avoid dealing with hexadecimal constants Karabiner gives them             -->
  <!-- names. E.g.: [ENTER] is 0x4c. Everywhere you see a Karabiner name you     -->
  <!-- should mentally think of it as a corresponding number or a physical       -->
  <!-- key. Think of names as placeholders or representations, not               -->
  <!-- meaning. These may later be mapped to something entirely different and    -->
  <!-- passed to your OS for further interpretation.                             -->
  <!--                                                                           -->
  <!-- NB: If you don't do anything fancy with your layout and you have a        -->
  <!-- standard QWERTY En keyboard chances are [osx] and [raw] will map onto     -->
  <!-- each other perfectly. Since this is the default we get really confused    -->
  <!-- when different layouts get into play, or seperate keys are re-mapped      -->
  <!-- to something different. If you remember one thing about Karabiner make    -->
  <!-- it this: it only deals with [raw] keys, which are referenced by their     -->
  <!-- names. This last point is the source of confusion, so always think:       -->
  <!-- name refers to a constant, not the meaning my mind is trying to attach    -->
  <!-- to it. Don't let your mind trick you. Who knew that phylosophy can be     -->
  <!-- so useful.                                                                -->
